    <strong><h1>Jessica "Jess" Ball</h1></strong>
    <br>
   <p>I was born in Salt Lake City, Utah and spent a couple years living in a few places across the valley
       and in Seattle, Washington. I love to hike, watch movies, play with my kids, crochet, plan vacations,
       and bake.  My favorite type of dog is a shiba inu and I grew up with lots of animals. I especially
       love dogs. I had Alaskan Malamutes and Siberian Huskies growing up. I currently don't have any pets at
       this time.
